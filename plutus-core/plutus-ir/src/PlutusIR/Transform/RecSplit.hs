{- Note [LetRec splitting pass]
This pass examines a single letrec group at a time
and maybe splits the group into sub-letgroups (rec or nonrec).

Invariants of the pass:

- Preserves the well-scopedness of the term.
- Does not turn an out-of-scope term into well-scoped.
- Does not place/move the sub-letgroups into locations other than the original letrec location (hole).
- Does not touch let-nonrec groups.

The (a) grouping into sub-letgroups
and the (b) order of appearance of these sub-groups inside the result term,
is determined by constructing locally a dependency graph between the bindings of the original let.

The created sub-letgroups will either be
(a) let-rec with 2 or more bindings
(b) let-nonrec with a single binding

Because of (b), it is advised to run the LetMerge pass *AFTER* this RecSplit pass, to group adjacent let-nonrecs.

This pass has the side-effect of demoting "fake" rec let-bindings into "true" nonrec let-bindings.
This gives an extra motivation to run the LetMerge pass *AFTER* this RecSplit pass.

Currently the implementation relies on 'Unique's, so there is the assumption of global uniqueness of the input term.
However, the algorithm could be changed to work without this assumption (has not been tested).
